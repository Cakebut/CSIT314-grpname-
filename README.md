# CSIT314 Crashout

A TypeScript + CSS project for CSIT314. This repository contains the source code for "Crashout" — a web-based project (game / interactive app) developed as part of the CSIT314 course. This README is a suggested, editable template that documents the repository, how to run it locally, how to contribute, and where to find important resources.

> NOTE: I inferred the project type from the repository name and the language composition (TypeScript and CSS). Please update the description, screenshots, and any commands below to match your actual project setup and scripts.

## Getting started

These are example instructions — adapt them to your repository's actual scripts and tools.

### Requirements

- Node.js (>= 16 recommended)
- npm (>= 8) or yarn / pnpm
- A modern browser for running the app

### Install

Clone the repository and install dependencies:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Cakebut/CSIT314Crashout.git
cd CSIT314Crashout
npm install
# or
# yarn
# pnpm install
```

### Run (development)

Start the development server (example scripts; update to match your package.json):

```bash
npm run dev
# or
npm start
```

Open http://localhost:3000 (or the port printed in console) in your browser.

### Build (production)

Create a production build:

```bash
npm run build
```

Output artifacts are typically placed in `dist/` or `build/`. Adjust as necessary.

### Test

If you have tests configured:

```bash
npm test
```

If not, consider adding unit tests (Jest / Vitest / Playwright for E2E) to improve reliability.
